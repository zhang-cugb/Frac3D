This part of the repository was forked from https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/benchmarks/fracture-flow-3d. The data repository accompanies the paper "Verification benchmarks for single-phase flow in three-dimensional fractured porous media", see the corresponding [call for participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06926).

The benchmark problem solved refers to the [single fracture problem](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/benchmarks/fracture-flow-3d/-/blob/master/single/scripts/single.ipynb) (Section "4.1 Case 1: single fracture" of the document).
